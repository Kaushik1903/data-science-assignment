In object-oriented programming, classes provide a way to define objects with certain properties and methods, but hide the underlying implementation details from the rest of the code. For example, you can define a class with public methods that expose its behavior, but keep the implementation details private.\n",

For example, in Java, you can define an interface that specifies the methods that must be implemented by a class that implements the interface.\n",
