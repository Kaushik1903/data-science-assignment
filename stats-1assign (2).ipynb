    "Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and describing the characteristics of a dataset. It is used to present and analyze data in a meaningful way. Some examples of descriptive statistics include: Measures of central tendency: Mean, median, and mode are measures of central tendency that indicate the average value of a dataset. Measures of variability: Range, variance, and standard deviation are measures of variability that describe how spread out the values in a dataset are. Frequency distribution: A frequency distribution shows the number of times each value appears in a dataset. Example: A researcher might use descriptive statistics to analyze the results of a survey about customer satisfaction. They could calculate the mean score, the standard deviation, and create a frequency distribution of the responses.\n",

    "Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics involves drawing conclusions and making predictions about a population based on a sample of data. It is used to test hypotheses and make generalizations about a larger group. Some examples of inferential statistics include: Hypothesis testing: Hypothesis testing involves using statistical methods to determine whether a hypothesis about a population is likely to be true or false. Confidence intervals: A confidence interval is a range of values within which we can be confident that the population parameter falls. Regression analysis: Regression analysis is a statistical method used to examine the relationship between two or more variables. Example: A pharmaceutical company might use inferential statistics to test the efficacy of a new drug. They could conduct a randomized controlled trial on a sample of patients and use statistical methods to determine whether the drug is effective for the larger population."
